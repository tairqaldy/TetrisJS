## 💡 What I Learned

- **Game Logic**: Handling Tetromino sequences, rotations, and collisions.
- **Canvas API**: Rendering the game board and Tetrominoes dynamically.
- **Randomization**: Generating random Tetromino sequences for gameplay.
- **Key Events**: Using `keydown` events for smooth and responsive controls.
